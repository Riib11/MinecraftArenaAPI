# MinecraftGameBase

This will be an complete API for making plugin-run minecraft games, featuring lobbies, arenas, spawns, teams, scorestats,
and all the basics you need. Reference this plugin in your build path and put it into your server's 'plugins' folder to use alongside your own plugin that unilizes this api (the jar of this plugin will do nothing by itself)
